I have speakers all over my house.

I like to minimize my power usage.

Sonos has no API.

This is a daemon that "listens" to the audio coming out of Sonos
(forked into my home server's line-in) and turns on & off my Denon
amps as needed.

Now when I come home & pull out my phone and pick some Pandora
station, the whole house turns on and parties with me.

And it means I never have to worry about turning off amps and wasting
my solar power. (hmm, waste solar power? maybe this project is
pointless.)
